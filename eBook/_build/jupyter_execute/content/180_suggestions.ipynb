    "In the previous chapter we started our modeling with the creation of a deterministic model. The underlying model for the glacier dynamics was purely driven by the mass balance and the geometry of the glacier. This meant that we were dealing with a one-input-one-output scenario. This is not the best approach if we want to do a forecasting of possible behavior of the glacier dynamics in the future. Ehat we would be looking for in  forecasting scenarios is to get a range of possible scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different ways to generate such probability scenarios. One is to run the model multiple times with slightly different start parameters and analyze the variability of the output. This will give us a range of possibilies for the future. This is called an ensemble approach where we derive distribution paramters from the set of outcomes from all the different scenarios. The probability distributions will then give us an idea about the expected mean and variance of the possible future scenarios.\n",
